I used Airbnb data for Boston and a bit for Seattle from the years 2016, 2017 to better understand:

1. If one want to get a credit for real estate where would it be to earn money and where to live?
2. Once one have chosen the city which location would bring more money or how the prices change inside the city?
3. How size of an apartment affect the price per night?
4. What else affect the price?
5. What is really matters to the guests?

There is one notrbook with the code that helps to answer the questions and visualize the results. In the notebook every step belongs to a question.
Excapt for the first four methods that aim to automize some repetitive processes in workint with the data sets.
